Solution Validator made with Java. 
Modern operating systems provide features for a process to use multiple threads for parallel operations. In the class, we have learned the concepts associated with multithreaded computer systems, such as multithreading models. There are various thread libraries. POSIX Pthreads and Java Threads are widely used for creating and managing threads. 
3 concurrent threads, each of which validates a part of the Sudoku solution.
Validation results given to report the number of valid rows, columns, and subgrids, and the overall validation result.
